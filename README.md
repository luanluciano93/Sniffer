# Sniffer
TibiaApi Packet Sniffer only for version 12.72 or higher. (Older protocols may not work as intended)

This program uses [TibiaApi](https://github.com/jo3bingham/TibiaAPI) made by [jo3bingham](https://github.com/jo3bingham), 

This is [my](https://github.com/marcosvf132/) fork of [AtefR](https://github.com/AtefR/Sniffer) repository, check his repository for more informations about the original version.

# How to use:

To use this program, first you need to edit your client.exe:

- Change it's RSA from original RSA to OpenTibia RSA.

- Change it's WebLoginService (Login IP) to http://127.0.0.1:7171/ or your custom port you want to use.

- If you don't know how to change this two things, use this excellent tutorial from [OtServ-BR](https://forums.otserv.com.br/index.php?/forums/topic/169530-cliente-tibia-1264-com-notepad/)

- Open this program, click on 'open' button, go to your client directory and select the file 'packages.json'. Notice that this file is not on 'bin' folder, but on the folder before it.

- Change the IP and port to the server you wan't to connect and click on 'connect'. There is another button on the side of it that shows the error log.

- Once you click on it, it's already ready to login. Run your client.exe with the IP and RSA changed and you can login on your character. If you are trying to connect to the official server, only enter on Zuna/Zunera world.

# Tracker:

- To initialize the tracker, open my edited version of remeres, open or create a new world and click on 'start tracker' on the 'tracker' tab. Make sure that your world have the right dimensions to fit the tracked map, otherwhise it won't work. 

# Is it safe?

- This program can work on official servers but please consider not doing it. I don't take any responsability of any damage it can cause to you or your account.
